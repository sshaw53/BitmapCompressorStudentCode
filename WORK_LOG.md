I'm trying to figure out how to minimize space, so I'm thinking of looping through the data initially to look for the longest instance and make sure that the radix representation of that uses minimal bytes for the rest of the cases. |

I don't think me finding my radix is working correctly. Maybe I should be using 32 bits in general rather than trying to modify it for every program. |
| Nov 19 |   11am-12pm   | I fixed lots of underlying issues within my code in getting the right radix, writing it into the compressed file correctly, etc. I had a big underlying issue that Mr. Blick spotted in my code: I wasn't reading my file in the way I had intended. My goal was to read it in bit by bit, but I didn't realize that I wasn't allowed to use getString() to get the data bit by bit, so I changed that to an arrayList and worked on my code from there. Now, I'm trying to see where I'm missing extra info, because my compressed file is too small. |

I had to write it out after the for-loop, and increase switches by one to take into account the first instance. I ended with a compression rate of 18% for the mystery file! |
